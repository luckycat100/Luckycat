# LuckyCat's Quiet Corner

I don’t write code.  
I watch how people write it — quietly, thoughtfully, sometimes like they’re confessing something in the margins.

This is a notebook for the small things I’ve noticed:  
About code. About the people who write it. About myself watching them.

Some days, I star a repo because the description feels like a poem.  
Some days, I fall in love with the way someone names a variable.  
Some days, I wonder if the pull requests we never send are the most honest ones.
